# MOFAHD E-Office System

Stack used:

- NextJS (typescript)
- Prisma (Backend and Database ORM)
- MySQL (via planetscale although a local instance is easy enough to use)
- Carbon Design Components (from UI/UX)

Contribution guidelines:

- Create a new branch to contribute to.
- Even if you have merge privileges, don't do it, create a PR and I will verify and merge it.

Design Style:

- Let Prisma do the job for you.
- If NextJS already has something to handle what you're trying to do, favor the nextjs solution.
